# Resize

## Really make sure you are in the right directory before running these scripts or it can change a lot of file

This is kinda a ridiculous thing I wanted to do thats overkill but I wanted to learn command line scripts and do a few specific things with image resizing.

### Careful to make sure this is in the right spot

```sh ~/Developer/resize/resize.sh```

### things to do 

- check how big something in an array is

[The Linux Documentation Project](https://tldp.org/guides.html)

- fi the end of an if statement is backwards if.
- sips this is the main tool we are using
  - -g = --getProperty
  - https://ss64.com/osx/sips.html

Theres some nice things like do ends in done. if ends in fi.

-p fails silently?

The -p flag will create nested directories, but only if they don't exist already.

we can only do one type of image per folder

## maybe I need to remove all folders before I start work?
