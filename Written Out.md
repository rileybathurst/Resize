# Written Out

Give myself a clear english guide to what I am doing so I dont get lost in the loop.

## Remove the spaces in names.

This matters as objects get messy with spaces

## Get the extension

Either jpeg or png to know we are dealing with only photos

### Once I figure it out allow this if its an extension I want

It'd be cool to have a break point we ask on if its not in the list

### Possible array of images

I'm having problems taking everything with the extentsion but I'd rather not do this

## Set the array of sizes we want exported

## Loop those sizes

## Check if its already smaller

Don't run the code if we are smaller
  Get going if it needs reworking

  ## Make a folder of each size

  ## Copy every image into each folder

  ## Move into each folder

  ## Resize each image

  ## Take the measurments of each image

  ## Move the image up a level

  While moving it up add the dimensions

  ## Level up to the main directory

## Remove anything thats not an image

aka folders

## If its the extension is a png

png has a nice command line compression

## Convert everything to webp

Maybe other next gen formats as well
